Last night, I partied a bit too hard
It's not quite coming back to me so far
I might not have slept, but I woke up a superstar
On another side of the world

I keep my head down
Stay away from the flash
The whole dancefloor is saying I've gotta smash
And I don't mind
'Cause it's all for the fans
And the next thing you know I'm big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's what you are, 'cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's what you are, 'cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

Now you know I gotta run
Got a shark on my back
I got a 10 ton agent wanna hear my track
This is gonna work, yeah this is amazing
We could take it to the world with a perfect timing
If you don't know how, you could do it like David
He's so hot right now he's a pretty big deal
Call a manager in to come up with a plan
And the next thing you know I'm big in Japan

Last night I partied a bit too hard
It's not quite coming back to me so far
I might not have slept but I woke up a superstar
On another side of the world

I'll keep my head down, stay away from the flash
The whole dancefloor is saying I've gotta smash
And I don't mind
'Cause it's all for the fans
Because the next thing you know I'm big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's what you are, 'cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's what you are, 'cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's what you are, 'cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's what you are, 'cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

Big in Japan, you big in Japan
Big in Japan, you big in Japan
