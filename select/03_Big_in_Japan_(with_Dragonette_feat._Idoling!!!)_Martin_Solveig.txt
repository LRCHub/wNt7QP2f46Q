I got a phone call
From across the hall
People knockin' on doors
I fell asleep on the floor
I think I'll be fine
I feel totally '90s
As I'm lying on the ground
In my smoking undies

Keep my head down
Look away from the flash
I got a planet full of people saying I got a smash
Me, I don't mind
'Cause it's all for the fans
And then the next thing you know I'm big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's what you are
'Cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's what you are
'Cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

Big in Japan
Big in Japan
Big in Japan
Big in Japan

Now you know I gotta run
Got a shark on my back
I got a ten ton agent wanna hear my tracks
This is gonna work
(Yeah) this is amazing
We could take it to the world
With a perfect timing

If you don't know how
You could do it like David
He's so hot right now
He's a pretty big deal
Cut a manager in to come up with a plan
And the next thing you know
I'm big in Japan

Big in Japan
Big in Japan

Keep my head down
Look away from the flash
I got a planet full of people saying I got a smash
Me, I don't mind
'Cause it's all for the fans
And then the next thing you know I'm big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's what you are
'Cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's what you are
'Cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's what you are
'Cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's what you are
'Cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

Big in Japan
Big in Japan
Big in Japan
Big in Japan
Big in Japan
Big in Japan
Big in Japan
Big in Japan

S-T-A-R
That's you are
'Cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan
